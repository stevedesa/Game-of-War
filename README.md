 * The purpose of this program is to conduct the Card Game of War!
   
 * The game begins with 2 options. Either the user provides 2 seeds which
   generates 2 52 card hands for the respective players or the user 
   provides 2 files filled with 52 integers mimicking cards to be placed in
   the hand. The program then takes the hands provided and converts them
   into cards with face values and suits for each respective hand. Then the
   Game of War begins!
  
 * The program conducts multiple rounds until one player wins by emptying
   the other player's hand. Each round involves placing the topmost card 
   of the player's stack. In case of a draw, a war is declared and each 
   player places down 3 cards. Then the topmost card is compared. If there 
   is another tie, another war is declared until there is a difference in 
   cards. In case of a tie and one player has less than 3 cards, both
   players put down cards till the player runs out. If there is again a tie,
   each player picks up each other's respective stack and this ends the round.
  
 * Hence, like this the program conducts multiple rounds till a winner is 
   found. Then, the winner is declared and both players' hands are
   displayed to the screen. This ends the program!!!
